This repository contains R code for implementing the spatial mixed models described in:

Kim, S., Wang, C., Kawk, S., Ahn, J., and Li, H., (2025+). Spatial mixed models for assessing environmental exposure effects on the microbiome.

## Files
- **sim_data_example.RData**  
  An example simulated dataset to illustrate the workflow and model fitting procedures.
- **Rcode.R**  
  The main R script that fits the models and performs the feature selection.

Users can load the simulated dataset and run Rcode.R to reproduce the analysis pipeline.
